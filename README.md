R scripts to apply different machine learning approaches for automated text classification

## Goal
Making customized scripts for automated text classifying available 

## Content
To apply certain machine learning approaches for automated text classifying in R i.a. data preprocessing, training and evaluation has to be performed in a certain way. This repository includes customized scripts for the following classifiers:
* Na√Øve Bayes (binary and multi-class)
* Support vector machine (binary and multi-class)
* Random forest (binary and multi-class)
* gradient boosting for decision trees (binary and multiclass)

Each script is organized as follows:
* required libraries
* Preprocessing
* Training 
* Model evaluation 

## Further Notes
**Important:** Cross-validation is heavily recommended for all approaches

Further approaches will be added soon (hopefully)
